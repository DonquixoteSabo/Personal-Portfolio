When I was making this project I didn't know how to use any kind of compiler so that's why I have few CSS files. All in all, I created this fully responsible project only using flexbox and media queries so that's why I think it's worth showing it.</p>",

For this project, I used typescript, Mock Service Worker, RTK Query, and so on.</p>",
